## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Based on Wikipedia<sub>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_metropolitan_area)</sub> and an article published in 2017 on AZ Central<sub>[[2]](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/06/11/phoenix-nation-5th-largest-but-real-city/369917001/)</sub>, Phoenix is one of the fastest growing metro areas within recent years and earned “two national distinctions with the U.S. Census Bureau numbers released Thursday [June 8, 2017]: Fifth-largest city and fastest-growing city.” However, due to its vast land mass within the [Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area) boundaries, this got some thinking it to be rather atypical of a “true city,” like New York City. Key neighborhoods being miles apart don’t fit together well for people seeking a traditional sense of one big city. Having been in the area a short while, I find that the uniqueness of the area is very much appreciated in recent urban developments that have injected pieces of the real city in many neighborhoods surrounding the urban core.  This adds a different kind of urban flavor that takes a typical city adventure beyond a congested concrete jungle.

## Problem Statement <a name="problem"></a>
If the types of opinions described above remains pervasive, it may discourage some city seekers like new families and young professionals to dismiss the opportunities that lies within Arizona. One way to help new prospects better appreciate the area is to explore the various neighborhoods with geolocation data from Foursquare and supplemental local datapoints to understand the composition of top activities, popular venues, and businesses within key neighborhoods. We can then compare these areas to those within a big city like New York City for context. With growth, comes economic development and increased business opportunities. Any similarities/differences found during the exploration could be leveraged to help identify potential pockets of opportunities. Let's see what the data can tell us during this data exploration exercise."

## Data Description <a name="data"></a>
### *Objectives*
* Compare/Contrast Phoenix's mix of popular venue preferences focusing on Maricopa county versus those of a more established city, NYC's Manhattan borough (county equivalent).
* Based on similarities/differences, are there opportunities to leverage with achievable local business statistics and demo overlays for Phoenix neighborhoods

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>
GitHub will be used as the main collaborative repository with a web based graphical interface to host the files for this project. The majority of the processing will be conducted from a Python notebook on the IBM Watson platform. The base geolocation files will be built off of publicly available neighborhood latitude/longitude for each area. A simple clustering exercise employing K-means algorithms will first be conducted on Foursquare social networking data to compare top activities within Phoenix versus those within Manhattan for observations of basic behavior differences. Key points of differentiation from Manhattan will be leveraged to further build out segmentation for the Phoenix area to help identify pockets of potential opportunity within like neighborhoods with added demographics similarities.

## Results and Discussion <a name="results"></a>
Phoenix is a large city with a growing population across a huge land mass. Many neighborhoods are very widespread with their own distinct flavors, which is why the clustering exercise during this study has shown difficulties in merging groups for classification. Unlike Manhattan, where the culture has been pretty established, patterns were not as easy to pick up for Phoenix area, even within the select county of Maricopa. The variety of neighborhoods and complexity of the make up requires a lot more data and time to drill in to test different methods and techniques for a more informed study. You can see the difference here within the sheer amount of different shadings across the two regions for the Esri Tapestry Segmentation schematics:

<table><tr>
    <td> <img src=\"https://github.com/bit-kitty/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/ProjectData/images/PHX-Esri-Segs.png?raw=true\" width=\"275\"> Maricopa (Phoenix) has upwards of 10+ segments</td>
    <td> <img src=\"https://github.com/bit-kitty/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/ProjectData/images/Manh-Esri-Segs.png?raw=true\" width=\"275\"> Manhattan (NYC) has mainly two segments</td>
    </tr></table>

Using the Kmeans algorithm as part of this clustering study, both the Elbow method and Silhouette scoring provided minimal assistance in selecting the optimum k. With guidance from other sources, two segments were teased out of Manhattan and six were forced within Maricopa county to seek out a group that fits loosely to characteristics for a potential up and coming \"Laptops and Lattes\" like segment. Cluster 2 for Maricopa showed some promising indications for providing services that would cater to younger, career-focused professionals with a busy lifestyle. Perhaps busines service around health and fitness or special quality dry cleaning services would support an active, on-the-go lifestyle for these individuals. With the lack of publicly available data readily available for the Phoenix neighborhoods, these opportunity suggestions are not fail proof. A lot of time was spent on manual collections of the minimal additional data points used to supplement the Foursquare venue data in the study. In future work, information that can programmatically be retrieved from paid platforms would be much more fruitful in conducting this type of work.

Additional data with respect to age, income, household size and ownership was manually compiled along with specific geo coordinates for key neighborhoods to assist in analyzing and translating the Maricopa County data. There is definitely a lot more intelligence to unearth for Phoenix with so much more opportunity for growth in both business and investments if key nuggets of information can be gained for analytics.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
This region is definitely unique and marches to the beat of it's own drums. Phoenix is a new type of city and should be appreciated for what it is instead of forcing it to replicate another New York, LA, or even Chicago. There's plenty of room for growth and development and a ton of adventures to be had.
