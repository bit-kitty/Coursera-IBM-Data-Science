## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Based on Wikipedia<sub>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_metropolitan_area)</sub> and an article published in 2017 on AZ Central<sub>[[2]](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2017/06/11/phoenix-nation-5th-largest-but-real-city/369917001/)</sub>, Phoenix is one of the fastest growing metro areas within recent years and earned “two national distinctions with the U.S. Census Bureau numbers released Thursday [June 8, 2017]: Fifth-largest city and fastest-growing city.” However, due to its vast land mass within the [Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metropolitan_area) boundaries, this got some thinking it to be rather atypical of a “true city,” like New York City. Key neighborhoods being miles apart don’t fit together well for people seeking a traditional sense of one big city. Having been in the area a short while, I find that the uniqueness of the area is very much appreciated in recent urban developments that have injected pieces of the real city in many neighborhoods surrounding the urban core.  

## Problem Statement <a name="problem"></a>
If naysayers' opinions about the city of Phoenix as described above remains pervasive, it may discourage some city seekers like new families and young professionals to dismiss the opportunities that lies within Arizona. One way to help new prospects better appreciate the area is to explore the various neighborhoods with geolocation data from Foursquare and supplemental local datapoints to understand the composition of top activities, popular venues, and businesses within key neighborhoods. We can then compare these areas to those within a big city like New York City for context. With growth, comes economic development and increased business opportunities. Any similarities/differences found during the exploration could be leveraged to help identify potential pockets of opportunities. Let's see what the data can tell us during this data exploration exercise.

## Data Description <a name="data"></a>
### *Objectives*
* Get to know the local neighborhoods of Maricopa County Phoenix better.
* Compare/Contrast Phoenix's mix of popular venue preferences focusing on Maricopa county versus those of a more established city, NYC's Manhattan borough (county equivalent).
* Based on similarities/differences to Manhattan, are there business or personal opportunities to leverage for the Phoenix metro area neighborhoods.

### *Sources*
* Foursquare<sub>[[3]](https://foursquare.com/)</sub> geolocation datasets will be used to pull sample sets of top venues within the radius of the main metro areas. Categories of these venues will be used to cluster like activities and provide some contextual understanding within each neighborhood based on matches to the dataset with neighborhoods and their identified lat/long coordinates.
   * Phoenix (County: Maricopa)
   * New York City (Borough: Manhattan)
* US state-county<sub>[[4]](https://www.geonames.org/)</sub> latitutude/longitude dataset will provide the set of county ZIP codes along with their lat/long coordinates that are needed to match to the Foursquare data.
* Supplemental manual neighborhood identification lookups will provide name identification of Phoenix neighborhoods since a set list is not readily available online. Any additional local statistics if pertinent to the analysis may be included from Phoenix local government sites.
   * US ZIP code lookups<sub>[[5]](https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/)</sub> for neighborhood names
   * Local AZ demographics data<sub>[[6]](https://arizona.hometownlocator.com/)</sub>
* United States Census Bureau<sub>[[7]](https://www.census.gov/data/data-tools.html/)</sub> will provide some national census related business statistics at the zip code level that may be pertinent to the evaluation exercise.
    * Business Statistics
* Given the shorten timeframe to turn around this analysis, supplemental location intelligence produced by Esri<sub>[[8]](https://www.esri.com/en-us/home)</sub> (an expert in geographic science and the builder of ArcGIS, a powerful mapping and spatial analytics software) will be used to help fill in characteristics about certain neighborhood segments within this study.
    * Esri's Tapestry Segmentation provides community lifestyle and demographic information

### *Challenges*
To note upfront, I did encounter a few challenges in the acquisition of ZIP code neighborhood data as well as the completeness of key indicators at that level code level for the Maricopa neighborhoods. This took a lot of set up time to structure the master datasets before any exploration could be conducted for the area. Although there are plenty of great data around, much of it is available at the county level, FIPS, or by census block and not directly for zip codes. Many sources that had zip code data were either selling them in bulk packages or selling a platform, sorftware, or database just to receive simple counts or statistics for a couple hundred ZIP codes. Therefore, I had to go the manual route and collect a few measures where I could to test viability to enhance the analytics. 

Typically, I would do a much more expansive exploratory analysis with thousands of variables and feature sets to iterate through and boil down to key components for modeling, but unfortunately this was not possible for this quick study. Even with the minimal data points not in excess of a few thousand rows, I was already running up against the dreaded IBM Watson message of using more than my monthly system quota and randomly getting kicked off the system. This definitely slowed my progress and I had to cut my evaluations short since I could not technically continue to vet the data more and finish in a timely manner. Despite the inability to be more exhaustive, I believe some interesting insights did emerge to pave the path for future work.

## Methodology <a name="methodology"></a>
GitHub will be used as the main collaborative repository with a web based graphical interface to host the files for this project. The majority of the processing will be conducted from a Python notebook on the IBM Watson platform. The base geolocation files will be built off of publicly available neighborhood latitude/longitude for each area. A simple clustering exercise employing K-means algorithms will first be conducted on Foursquare social networking data to compare top activities within Phoenix versus those within Manhattan for observations of basic behavior differences. Key points of differentiation from Manhattan will be leveraged to further build out segmentation for the Phoenix area to help identify pockets of potential opportunity within like neighborhoods with some demographics overlay for context.

Using the Kmeans algorithm as part of this clustering study, both the Elbow method and Silhouette scoring provided minimal assistance in selecting the optimum k using Foursquare venue category data. Starting with the Foursquare venue categories and the Manhattan borough lat/long dataset that was briefly used during the last coursework.

With guidance from other sources, two segments were teased out for Manhattan and six were forced within Maricopa county to seek out a group that fits loosely to characteristics for a potential up and coming "Laptops and Lattes" like segment. In observing the visualization of the Foursquare segmented venue clusters for Manhattan, they do in fact, resemble the shapes of the Tapestry Segmentation developed by Esri (pictured below). With the limited amount of time for this study, I took advantage of this alignment and applied the basic demoographics findings from Esri to help explain the additional nuances of our newly formed venue based segments.

![Manhattan Clusters](https://github.com/bit-kitty/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/ProjectData/images/Manh_Cluster_Map.png?raw=true "Title")

As you can see, the plotted clusters above align fairly well with those of the Esri Tapestry segments in Manhattan for Laptops and Lattes (light blue blocks) and High Rise Renters (purple blocks). Cluster 1 (red pins) appear to match more so to the High Rise Renters. Cluster 2 (purple pins) maps more to the Laptops and Lattes group.

## Results and Discussion <a name="results"></a>
As mentioned earlier, there were many unexpected challenges to completing this study in a more thorough manner. Phoenix is a large city with a growing population across a huge land mass. Many neighborhoods are very widespread with their own distinct flavors, which is why the clustering exercise during this study has shown difficulties in merging groups for segmentation. Unlike Manhattan, where the culture has been pretty established, patterns were not as easy to pick up for the Phoenix area, even within the select county of Maricopa. The variety of neighborhoods and complexity of the make up requires a lot more data and time to drill in and test different methods and techniques for a more informed study. You can see the visual differences here by the amount of different shadings across the two regions within the Esri Tapestry Segmentation schematics:

        <p align="center"><sub>Maricopa (Phoenix) has upwards of 10+ segments</sub></p></td>
    <td align="center"><img src="https://github.com/bit-kitty/Coursera_Capstone/blob/master/ProjectData/images/Manh-Esri-Segs.png?raw=true" width="275">
        <p align="center"><sub>Manhattan (NYC) has basically two main segments</sub></p></td>
    </tr></table></center>

Cluster 2 for Maricopa showed some promising indications for providing services that would cater to younger, career-focused professionals with a busy lifestyle. Perhaps busines service around health and fitness or special quality dry cleaning services would support an active, on-the-go lifestyle for these individuals. With the lack of publicly available data readily available for the Phoenix neighborhoods, these opportunity suggestions are not fail proof. A lot of time was spent on manual collections of the minimal additional data points used to supplement the Foursquare venue data in the study. In future work, information that can programmatically be retrieved from paid platforms would be much more fruitful in conducting this type of work.

Additional data with respect to age, income, household size and ownership was manually compiled along with specific geo coordinates for key neighborhoods to assist in analyzing and translating the Maricopa County data. There is definitely a lot more intelligence to unearth for Phoenix with so much more opportunity for growth in both business and investments if key nuggets of information can be gained for analytics.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>
The Phoenix metropolitan region is definitely unique and marches to the beat of it's own drums. It is a new type of city and should be appreciated for what it is becoming instead of forcing it to replicate another New York, LA, or even Chicago. With dispersed areas of city living, this adds a different kind of urban flavor that takes a typical city adventure beyond a congested concrete jungle. There's obviously plenty of room for growth, development, and a ton of indoor/outdoor adventures to be had.
