Key neighborhoods being miles apart don\u2019t fit together well for people seeking a traditional sense of one big city. Having been in the area a short while, I find that the uniqueness of the area is very much appreciated in recent urban developments that have injected pieces of the real city in many neighborhoods surrounding the urban core.  This adds a different kind of urban flavor that takes a typical city adventure beyond a congested concrete jungle.",

One way to help new prospects better appreciate the area is to explore the various neighborhoods with geolocation data from Foursquare and supplemental local datapoints to understand the composition of top activities, popular venues, and businesses within key neighborhoods. We can then compare these areas to those within a big city like New York City for context. With growth, comes economic development and increased business opportunities. Any similarities/differences found during the exploration could be leveraged to help identify potential pockets of opportunities. Let's see what the data can tell us during this data exploration exercise.",

Any additional local statistics if pertinent to the analysis may be included from Phoenix local government sites.\n    * US Zip Code lookups for neighborhood names\n    * Local Demographics Data  \n\n\n* Census.gov will provide some national census related business statistics at the zip code level that may be pertinent to the evaluation exercise.\n    * Business Statistics",
